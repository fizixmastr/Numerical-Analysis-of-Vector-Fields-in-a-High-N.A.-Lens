Influence of the waveguide height, etch depth, waveguide width and operation wavelength to the mode number, mode size, birefringence and polarization sensitivity were analyzed with Beam Propagation Method. Design parameters for targeted properties are computed for waveguide widths ranging from 0 to 10 µm, and for etch depth ranging from 0 to 0.5 µm for fixed waveguide height of 0.5 µm. A design window for a fixed width of 3.5 µm and etch depths between 0.325 to 0.375 µm is identified for single mode, wavelength and polarization insensitive operation of Al2O3 waveguides on thermal oxide. A novel rib TE mode selective filter design is also suggested as an output of the numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Guided wave-optics has emerged as a promising platform for label free biosensing. However, device sensitivity toward surface-bound small molecules is directly limited by the evanescent interaction and low confinement factor with the active sensing region. Here, we report a mesoporous silicon waveguide design and inverse fabrication technique that resolves the evanescent field interaction limitation while achieving maximal transverse confinement factors and preserving single-mode operation. The waveguide sensors are characterized in a Fabry-Perot interferometer configuration and the ultra-high sensitivity to small molecule adlayers is demonstrated. We also identify dispersion to be a promising degree of freedom for exceeding the sensitivity limits predicted by the conventional non-dispersive effective medium theory.},

As one class of spatially variant polarization, cylindrical vector beams are the axially symmetric beam solution to the full vector electromagnetic wave equation. These beams can be generated via different active and passive methods. Techniques for manipulating these beams while maintaining the polarization symmetry have also been developed. Their special polarization symmetry gives rise to unique high-numerical-aperture focusing properties that find important applications in nanoscale optical imaging and manipulation. The prospects for cylindrical vector beams and their applications in other fields are also briefly discussed.},
